## Description
In this sample project the aim is to demonstrate how reliability analyses can be conducted in R with real-world data.
The intended outcome of the modelling is to allow us to estimate some properties of the reliability of a system, or of a component of a system, including predicting the mean time-to-failure (MTTF).

We have moved the original analysis of this data in R: [Reliability Analysis in R](https://systemhealthlab.com/research-tools/example-of-a-reliability-analysis-in-r/) to this Git Hub site to make it easier for people to access, clone and contribute updates to.

## Usage/Installation
Install R Studio. See https://www.rstudio.com/ for details.
